| 10   | Resourceful | Always seems to have what they need on hand; may spend 10 Luck points (rather than make Luck roll) to find a certain useful piece of equipment in their current location. |

## Step 4: Determine Occupation

Choose one occupation to make note of the skills, and the credit rating. The credit rating range as it will provide the minimum starting level and ceiling that you can reach. For example an occupation with a credit rating range of 5 - 30 must start play with at least 5 points spent on the hero's credit rating, unless approved by the Keeper.

## Step 5: Decide Skills and Allocate Skill Points

You may allocate skills to be above 100%.

It is a good idea to have 3 skills in the 40 - 80% range than 3 or 4 skills in the 90 - 100% range.

### Occupation Skill Points

Allocate all of the skills points from the occupation. Occupational skill points cannot be spent on skills other than those listed as part of the occupation.

#### Credit Rating

An investigator's credit rating starts at 0 and must be at least at the lowest level that the occupation provides. For example an occupation of crafts person has a credit rating range of 10 - 40. You must spend at least 10 points on your hero's credit rating during the occupational skill phase.

Personal interest skill points may be spent on the hero's credit rating as well, and used to bring the hero's credit rating above the occupation's credit rating range.

### Personal Interest Skills

Multiply your hero's INT by 2 and allocate the result as point to any skill, including occupational or archetype skills. Note that you cannot allocate personal interest skill points to Cthulhu Mythos unless the Keeper agrees.

## Step 6: Create Backstory

A hero's backstory is not only helpful to know, but also important to the sanity mechanic. For example, spending time at a meaningful location, or with a loved on will give the hero the opportunity to restore lost sanity points. There are 10 types of backstory details, if possible fill in detail for at least the first six. For your convenience a variety have tables have been provided below that you can roll on to determine a part of your hero's backstory. Using these tables is completely optional.

1. Personal Description
2. Ideology/Beliefs
3. Significant People
4. Meaningful Locations
5. Treasured Possessions
6. Traits
7. Injuries & Scars
8. Phobias & Manias
9. Arcane Tomes, Spells, and Artifacts
10. Encounters with Strange Entities

### Key Connection

Key connections are especially helpful at aiding hero's in regaining sanity. Choose one key connection out of your backstory, more can be created throughout game play. Make sure to make the key connection on your character sheet.
